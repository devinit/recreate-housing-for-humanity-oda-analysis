Sida has made an assessment and proposes a 4-year long support (2019-2022), amounting to 275 million SEK. The overarching objective of the intervention is to address the extensive global deficit of affordable and adequate housing and access to basic services such as water and sanitation for people living in poverty. More than one billion people live in informal settlements with substandard access to water and sanitation. By producing affordable houses, the intervention intends to demonstrate that perceived and real obstacles to a functioning sector for affordable housing can be overcome. The intention is that this will attract international and local banks as well as professional building companies and thus catalyse a wider effect. The houses are to be designed to addresses identified blockages to a functioning market for affordable houses and/or bread new grounds in relation to target group, design solutions, financing solutions or other identified needs to systematically address the housing shortage. Dissemination of results and active advocacy efforts to achieve policy development and sustainable financing solutions is to be done continuously. The production of the houses is done by local organisations that are part of Reall s network, through which they receive capacity development support and financing. The local organisations are supported to be able to design and build well planned, affordable and environmentally sustainable houses with a high level of target group participation. Because of lack of other end-user finance alternatives, most of the network organisations provides this service for the target group. Central aspects of the intervention are, -to prove that poor people can and want to finance their own home when the right conditions exist and-to demonstrate that solid work with transparency and a very high level of internal governance and control can make construction processes predictable and reduce the risk of corruption.These two areas are crucial to attract both financiers and other players to the market for low-cost housing.Reall is a non-profit organization based in the UK that supports a network of local organizations. Upon successful assessments, Reall forwards grants to these organisations for functional costs and soft loans for them to build qualitative housing for people with an income between 10-40% on their respective country s income pyramid. The network has presently members in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Angola, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India, Burkina Faso, Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria and Mozambique.Concrete results expected to be generated include 4,000 new adequate and affordable homes, of which an increasing proportion are owned by women or jointly by a man and a woman, as well as an increasing degree of houses adapted","6.2,6.1,11.c,11.7,11.3,11.1",,1,1,1,,1,0,,1,,1,,,0,0,1,0,2019-05-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The remittance market has simultaneously changed remarkably, the amount of migrants in the world between the years 2010 and 2018 increased from 220 millions to 272 millions and the estimated total value of remittances across the world increased from 296 to 528 billion USD between the years of 2007 to 2018. Of those in the world who live in extreme poverty, three quarters live in rural areas in the Global South. A majority of those rely on agriculture as their main source of income. Beyond that, forty percent of all remittances are estimated to go directly to rural areas, and approximately seventy-five percent of the remittances which are sent to families are estimated to contribute to the fulfillment of basic needs such as food, health care, education, and housing. The families that receive remittances generally work and live outside of the financial systems, in financial exclusion, and thus lack access to simple financial services such as savings and credit. The FFR s main goal is to maximize the development impact of migrant worker remittances and diaspora investments by working to develop the remittance market and foster financial inclusion. It is in Sida s assessment that a support to FFR of 40 MSEK, divided in 10 MSEK yearly during the course of four years (2020-2023) will contribute to the implementation of the strategy for Sweden s global development cooperation in sustainable economic development 2018-2022. It is also a possibility to support a contribution directly aimed at fulfilling the strategy target 1.2 Strengthened capacity to take advantage of the positive effects of migration, while also contributing to the increase in financial inclusion and strengthening of women s economic empowerment for rural populations in the Global South. Thus far the program has mobilized 96.9 million USD through 60 different projects where the direct recipients are governments, institutions, regulators and organisations within the private and public sector that work within the field of remittances and diaspora investment. The final beneficiaries are migrants in the host countries and their families, mainly in rural areas, who receive remittances and whom through the programme will benefit from new instruments and methods to in a more efficient and sustainable way receive and handle remittances. Through its financial support to FFR and the support to these specific target groups, Sida estimates that they will also be able to facilitate further development in rural communities as a whole.","8.3,8.10,5.b,5.a,1.4,1.1",,0,0,0,,0,0,,0,,1,,,0,0,0,0,2020-01-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The network now brings together over a million slum dwellers in over 34 countries throughout Africa, Asia and Latin America. SDI has a professional Secretariat based in Cape Town, which is Sida s agreement partner.SDI's vision is for  resilient and inclusive cities that substantively improve the lives of the urban poor . Its mission is  to transform slums into resilient neighborhoods and inclusive cities by collectively driving a women-led, bottom-up change agenda for securing tenure, and increasing access to basic services, housing and livelihoods .The core unit of SDI is the women-led savings group at the community- or slum settlement level. Members of the savings group become part of a national federation, which is then affiliated with the global SDI umbrella.The proposed agreement for 2018-2022 intends to continue strengthening the core activities of SDI and support implementation of the new strategic plan. Sida also intends to follow-up on growth and improvement areas that have been recommended by the 2017 independent evaluation and adopted by the SDI board. These include: expanding and deepening the savings groups at the settlement level, exploring new financing instruments and sources, engaging youth, ensuring a sustainable leadership, strengthening risk management and the organisational culture of accountability, and using SDI data and experiences to influence policies and programs at the city- and country level. Sida s support is also intended to consolidate SDI s work in fighting and negotiating alternatives to evictions. Forwarding of funds to third parties (i.e., support organisations) has been assessed as part of this agreement.Sida proposes a total contribution of SEK 190 000 000 during this new phase, 2018-2022, and is intended to scale-up the work of SDI in the countries where they operate. The previous contribution was SEK 98 000 000 during 2014-2018. The decision to increase the support by 100% is partly based on SDI s proven capacity to deliver concrete results for its slum dweller members, and also based on the urgency of the slum problem and the urbanisation of poverty. The UN estimates that there are now a billion slum dwellers living in the urban centres of low- and middle-income countries. In this context, SDI is unique because it brings together people from this group to organise and improve their own lives through concrete actions at the settlement-, city-, country- and global levels. The cooperation with SDI is relevant to the Swedish global strategy for sustainable environment, climate and oceans, 2018-2022, specifically, the following sub-goals: Environmentally sustainable cities and communities, and Increased access to basic social services and housing for people living in poverty in urban areas.

The rapid urbanization is caused by significant forced displacements from rural areas into urban areas driven by conflicts, insecurity, search for economic opportunities and cyclical environmental adversities such as drought and famine. This has a huge impact not only upon livelihood opportunities, peace and stability and resilience, but also shifting rural and pastoralist livelihood to urban economies. The urban influx raises many challenges for the provision of basic urban services including secure access to land for settlement of IDPs and existing vulnerable communities. Lack of effective land administration and planning systems and weak institutions has led to arbitrary distribution of land and has aggravated contestation over land, housing and basic services. Intense competition over land exacerbates forced evictions particularly among IDPs and urban poor.The focus of this programme will be to promote inclusive employment opportunities for urban vulnerable populations, increase youth participation, integration of displacement affected households and to strengthen implementation of Durable Solutions and Youth development across Somalia.

The remittance market has simultaneously changed remarkably, the amount of migrants in the world between the years 2010 and 2018 increased from 220 millions to 272 millions and the estimated total value of remittances across the world increased from 296 to 528 billion USD between the years of 2007 to 2018. Of those in the world who live in extreme poverty, three quarters live in rural areas in the Global South. A majority of those rely on agriculture as their main source of income. Beyond that, forty percent of all remittances are estimated to go directly to rural areas, and approximately seventy-five percent of the remittances which are sent to families are estimated to contribute to the fulfillment of basic needs such as food, health care, education, and housing. The families that receive remittances generally work and live outside of the financial systems, in financial exclusion, and thus lack access to simple financial services such as savings and credit.

The initiative is an integral part of UCLG s Strategic Plan 2016-2022.UCLG is a global membership-based organization for municipalities, regional authorities and cities and gathers actors in over 120 countries in all of the world's regions. UCLG supports partnerships and collaborations between members and engages in extensive advocacy in international contexts. A guiding principle for UCLG s work is that decentralization and strengthening of local capacity are of central importance for sustainable development. The long-term priorities are defined in UCLG's Strategic Priorities 2016-2022, which particularly emphasizes the importance of local ownership and that the contributions of municipalities and cities towards the realization of Agenda 2030 need to be adapted to local conditions and needs. UCLG has established partnerships with several multilateral and bilateral actors, including the EU, which is the largest donor on the basis of a multi-year strategic partnership.As an integral facet of UCLG s strategy, Local4Action Hub is a facility to support and catalyse action-oriented implementation in line with the strategy s overal goal to strengthening the role of cities and municipalities in influencing, implementing and monitoring the global development agendas. The cooperation with Sida is designed as a program support for this facility and thereby aims to scale up prioritized activities related to advocacy, policy, knowledge management and various operations (incl. decentralised cooperation and municipal peer-exchange) aimed at strengthening members' capacity to implement Agenda 2030 at local level. The initiative intends to build the capacity of local governments to address poverty, exclusion and gender inequality. The work plan draws to a large extent on the needs and priorities identified by UCLG s members, with specific focus on SDG 11 but with bearing on the SDG-agenda at large. Themes and areas that may be addressed within specific activities include, for instance, climate adaptation, housing and basic services delivery, resilience and DRR, integrated urban planning, local economic development, migration, women s representation in policy- and decision-making processes, etc. UCLG's World Secretariat based in Barcelona will lead the implementation of theinitiative, whereas the geographical sections (i.e., UCLG-Asia Pacific, UCLG Africa) will be involved in key activities through sub-granting arrangements.","5.5,11.b,11.3",,1,2,2,,0,1,,0,,1,,,1,1,1,0,2019-06-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is achieved through secondments to UN agencies, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and international NGOs, but also through logistical support and housing and office solutions. The current grant agreement between Sida and MSB covers the period 2022-2025.As a Swedish governmental agency, MSB and its part in Sida's humanitarian assistance facilitates broader relations in the countries they operate in and with the organizations they cooperate with. A significant part of MSB's humanitarian operations aims to enable humanitarian activities in hard to reach areas, including by creating the necessary conditions for UN agencies and international NGOs to live, work and operate in those areas through housing and office solutions. MSB also contributes to strengthening the UN system through their thematic expertise by seconding specialists and experts in an array of thematic areas. In the previous agreement period, MSB showcased good results and is deemed to play a relevant role in the operationalization of the Swedish humanitarian assistance strategy.

The rapid urbanization is caused by significant forced displacements from rural areas into urban areas driven by conflicts, insecurity, search for economic opportunities and cyclical environmental adversities such as drought and famine. This has a huge impact not only upon livelihood opportunities, peace and stability and resilience, but also shifting rural and pastoralist livelihood to urban economies. The urban influx raises many challenges for the provision of basic urban services including secure access to land for settlement of IDPs and existing vulnerable communities. Lack of effective land administration and planning systems and weak institutions has led to arbitrary distribution of land and has aggravated contestation over land, housing and basic services. Intense competition over land exacerbates forced evictions particularly among IDPs and urban poor.The focus of this programme will be to promote inclusive employment opportunities for urban vulnerable populations, increase youth participation, integration of displacement affected households and to strengthen implementation of Durable Solutions and Youth development across Somalia.

They are experiencing greater food insecurity and are suffering more from the cascading impacts of natural hazards and climate change. Yet every day, they produce informal, bottom-up solutions to these problems, transforming public spaces, housing, and urban conditions at the margins of the authorities' influences and plans. These bottom-up solutions are still not fully understood, and little is known about how conditions of urban informality — where infrastructure and services are scarce, land tenure is disputed, governance structures are fragile, and housing conditions are poor — influence the emergence, sustainability, and scaling of alternative food systems. These are food systems that are local, healthy, equitable, inclusive, and culturally relevant.  This project seeks to explore: (a) how bottom-up informal solutions interact with food systems and contribute to making them more resilient to shocks such as climate change and pandemics, (b) how urban systems such as infrastructure and housing in informal settlements influence the resilience and vulnerability of alternative food systems and, by doing so, how they influence people's capacity to deal with climate change impacts, and (c) the conditions for scaling impact, transferring results, and overcoming implementation barriers towards resilient alternative food systems in Latin America and the Caribbean.   The aim is to use such knowledge to support on-the-ground, locally specific efforts to strengthen alternative food systems, as well as to generate and practice lessons related to the food system, with a view to reducing vulnerabilities and building resilience. The project will involve research, training, and implementation activities in four countries: Ecuador, Colombia, Chile, and Cuba. It will also include networking and sharing of activities among the four countries as well as other countries of the Dry Corridor of Central America. It will produce new knowledge and yield policy changes through innovative explorations that combine empirical research, action research, and design.

Other Multisector,51000,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank",Université de Montréal,51000,,,,2021-08-01,2025-08-01,"In Latin America and the Caribbean, as elsewhere, low-income and marginalized communities have seen their vulnerability exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. They are experiencing greater food insecurity and are suffering more from the cascading impacts of natural hazards and climate change. Yet every day, they produce informal, bottom-up solutions to these problems, transforming public spaces, housing, and urban conditions at the margins of the authorities' influences and plans. These bottom-up solutions are still not fully understood, and little is known about how conditions of urban informality — where infrastructure and services are scarce, land tenure is disputed, governance structures are fragile, and housing conditions are poor — influence the emergence, sustainability, and scaling of alternative food systems. These are food systems that are local, healthy, equitable, inclusive, and culturally relevant.  This project seeks to explore: (a) how bottom-up informal solutions interact with food systems and contribute to making them more resilient to shocks such as climate change and pandemics, (b) how urban systems such as infrastructure and housing in informal settlements influence the resilience and vulnerability of alternative food systems and, by doing so, how they influence people's capacity to deal with climate change impacts, and (c) the conditions for scaling impact, transferring results, and overcoming implementation barriers towards resilient alternative food systems in Latin America and the Caribbean.   The aim is to use such knowledge to support on-the-ground, locally specific efforts to strengthen alternative food systems, as well as to generate and practice lessons related to the food system, with a view to reducing vulnerabilities and building resilience. The project will involve research, training, and implementation activities in four countries: Ecuador, Colombia, Chile, and Cuba. It will also include networking and sharing of activities among the four countries as well as other countries of the Dry Corridor of Central America. It will produce new knowledge and yield policy changes through innovative explorations that combine empirical research, action research, and design. These activities will help enhance local capacity and interaction among community leaders, public officials, and academic partners, and better equip communities and institutions to address the challenges of food insecurity and natural hazards in the coming years.","2,13",,1,1,,,0,0,0,0,1,,,,0,0,2,0,2021-07-20,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,

Yet every day, they produce informal, bottom-up solutions to these problems, transforming public spaces, housing, and urban conditions at the margins of the authorities' influences and plans. These bottom-up solutions are still not fully understood, and little is known about how conditions of urban informality — where infrastructure and services are scarce, land tenure is disputed, governance structures are fragile, and housing conditions are poor — influence the emergence, sustainability, and scaling of alternative food systems. These are food systems that are local, healthy, equitable, inclusive, and culturally relevant.  This project seeks to explore: (a) how bottom-up informal solutions interact with food systems and contribute to making them more resilient to shocks such as climate change and pandemics, (b) how urban systems such as infrastructure and housing in informal settlements influence the resilience and vulnerability of alternative food systems and, by doing so, how they influence people's capacity to deal with climate change impacts, and (c) the conditions for scaling impact, transferring results, and overcoming implementation barriers towards resilient alternative food systems in Latin America and the Caribbean.   The aim is to use such knowledge to support on-the-ground, locally specific efforts to strengthen alternative food systems, as well as to generate and practice lessons related to the food system, with a view to reducing vulnerabilities and building resilience. The project will involve research, training, and implementation activities in four countries: Ecuador, Colombia, Chile, and Cuba. It will also include networking and sharing of activities among the four countries as well as other countries of the Dry Corridor of Central America. It will produce new knowledge and yield policy changes through innovative explorations that combine empirical research, action research, and design. These activities will help enhance local capacity and interaction among community leaders, public officials, and academic partners, and better equip communities and institutions to address the challenges of food insecurity and natural hazards in the coming years.","2,13",,1,1,,,0,0,0,0,1,,,,0,0,2,0,2021-07-20,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,

Government policies such as the Kenya Vision 2030 and the Big 4 Agenda — which identify affordable housing as a key priority — further support the growth of this sector. Despite the clear opportunity, women are underrepresented in this sector, accounting for just 3% of workers.  This project will examine the effectiveness of an innovative initiative aimed at fostering entry and retainment of women in the construction sector in Kenya, developed by a local non-profit social enterprise, Buildher. The project will explore what works to increase women's successful participation in this male-dominated sector and whether and how lessons and successes can be scaled. It will develop insights on how women can be supported by employers, communities, and training providers to enter and succeed in the construction sector.  In addition, Kenya's construction industry has been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the country puts in place measures to support the sector, it is important to ensure that such measures do not further marginalize women and to introduce measures to redress the entrenched gender barriers. Insights from this project will provide valuable input to inform government and private sector actions in building back better.  This project is supported under the Growth and Economic Opportunities for Women (GrOW) East Africa initiative, jointly funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and IDRC.

In Central America, five million poor people living in houses made of mud, adobe, or thatch materials are at risk of contracting Chagas disease. The most important Chagas transmission vector in the region is Triatoma dimidiata, a native insect with the capacity to re-infest houses a few months after chemical spraying. Despite longstanding insecticide-based control measures to eliminate household infestation, Chagas transmission persists in many rural areas of the region. Following the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Committee for Chagas Control in Central America and Mexico, novel control interventions, including house improvements, will soon start in priority disease hotspots. Past research has shown that long-lasting, low-cost, and culturally adapted house improvements are successful in making houses resistant to vector re-infestation and preventing infection.   This project, implemented in partnership with the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala, will demonstrate the feasibility of eliminating Chagas as a public health threat in a highly endemic area, and set the basis for its replication in other hotspots of Central America and Mexico. It will take place in the most important hotspot of Chagas transmission located along the Guatemala-El Salvador border,  targeting 48 rural communities of the Jutiapa Department in Guatemala. In addition to reducing disease transmission, the project will significantly improve the living conditions of 32,400 vulnerable people.  An integrated disease control plan will combine community actions to reduce transmission risk factors (such as housing improvements) with access to timely diagnoses and treatment of infected individuals. Among the activities are training for health professionals in the development, evaluation, and integration of this approach into national public health policies, and reinforcement of surveillance systems.   IDRC, in partnership with the Drugs for Neglected Disease Initiative and in collaboration with the Pan American Health Organization, aim to expand donor support and local action to halt the transmission of this entirely preventable, costly, and debilitating disease.",3,,0,0,,,1,0,0,0,1,,,,0,0,0,0,2021-12-31,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,

They are experiencing greater food insecurity and are suffering more from the cascading impacts of natural hazards and climate change. Yet every day, they produce informal, bottom-up solutions to these problems, transforming public spaces, housing, and urban conditions at the margins of the authorities' influences and plans. These bottom-up solutions are still not fully understood, and little is known about how conditions of urban informality — where infrastructure and services are scarce, land tenure is disputed, governance structures are fragile, and housing conditions are poor — influence the emergence, sustainability, and scaling of alternative food systems. These are food systems that are local, healthy, equitable, inclusive, and culturally relevant.  This project seeks to explore: (a) how bottom-up informal solutions interact with food systems and contribute to making them more resilient to shocks such as climate change and pandemics, (b) how urban systems such as infrastructure and housing in informal settlements influence the resilience and vulnerability of alternative food systems and, by doing so, how they influence people's capacity to deal with climate change impacts, and (c) the conditions for scaling impact, transferring results, and overcoming implementation barriers towards resilient alternative food systems in Latin America and the Caribbean.   The aim is to use such knowledge to support on-the-ground, locally specific efforts to strengthen alternative food systems, as well as to generate and practice lessons related to the food system, with a view to reducing vulnerabilities and building resilience. The project will involve research, training, and implementation activities in four countries: Ecuador, Colombia, Chile, and Cuba. It will also include networking and sharing of activities among the four countries as well as other countries of the Dry Corridor of Central America. It will produce new knowledge and yield policy changes through innovative explorations that combine empirical research, action research, and design. These activities will help enhance local capacity and interaction among community leaders, public officials, and academic partners, and better equip communities and institutions to address the challenges of food insecurity and natural hazards in the coming years.","2,13",,1,1,,,0,0,0,0,1,,,,0,0,2,0,2021-07-20,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,

Poor access to services creates acute risks of insecurity for women and girls and denies them their dignity. The last decade, however, has seen concerted efforts to stem the deep inequality and exclusion in Nairobi's informal settlements. Special planning areas (SPAs) have emerged as a transformational model to spur redevelopment, first in the Mukuru area, with plans to replicate those efforts in the Kibera neighbourhood and the Mathare Valley. In Zambia, new urban-planning powers to create improvement areas and title urban properties offer promise to support large-scale redevelopment.   Building on those opportunities, this project will bring together grassroots movements, local authorities, universities, and civil society organizations to co-produce knowledge needed to foster inclusive and equitable change. In Nairobi, the project team will lead research to identify options for overcoming land tenure impediments to SPA processes in Kibera and Mathare. They will document ongoing support under the Mukuru SPA to apply emerging lessons across research sites. In Kitwe, Zambia, the project team will undertake a situational analysis that will serve as a basis for developing an integrated local area plan for the Ipusukilo settlement. Data collection across sites will involve strong participation of residents as part of larger efforts to place the urban poor at the centre of planning processes.   This project was selected for funding through a competitive call for proposals entitled Closing the justice gap - a legal empowerment research and learning agenda. The resulting cohort of projects will cover 12 country case studies in West Africa, East and Southern Africa, and Southeast Asia, and include a regional hub for each of those sub-regions.",10,,1,0,2,,0,0,0,0,1,,,,0,0,0,0,2021-08-12,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,

This is particularly true for LGBT+ groups who already face elevated rates of physical and mental health challenges, as well as socio-structural barriers that limit the effectiveness and feasibility of recommended preventive measures such as physical distancing and handwashing. These health and social disparities greatly increase the vulnerability of LGBT+ people to COVID-19, and compound with other forms of marginalization such as race/ethnicity, gender, age, and HIV status, as well as unstable housing and employment, healthcare discrimination, and violence. There is an absence of coordinated and community-engaged responses to reduce the risk of COVID-19 for these groups.   To address these challenges, this project will adapt, test, and disseminate a community-engaged eHealth intervention with diverse LGBT+ populations to reduce their risk of COVID-19 infection. The research team will test the intervention's effectiveness in increasing COVID-19 knowledge and protective behaviours, and in reducing psychological distress among LGBT+ people in Canada, India, and Thailand. The results of this project will reduce the risk of COVID-19 for LGBT+ people and will also better inform health system and public health responses to support engagement of LGBT+ and other marginalized populations in the pandemic response.

With already weak health systems and limited diagnostic capabilities, developing countries are particularly at risk of the outbreak spreading, potentially bearing a disproportionate share of the cost of the outbreak in terms of human suffering and economic impact. In addition, the disease and necessary containment measures will disproportionately harm the poor and other vulnerable groups in developing countries. This is further exacerbated by existing epidemic breakouts in various developing regions. Moreover, around urban centers in emerging markets and developing economies, the poor are often more likely to live in densely populated housing and large parts of the population have uneven access to water, sanitation and healthcare, making social distancing and personal hygiene difficult.  Equitable access to a vaccine represents one of the greatest hopes to contain and ultimately suppress the pandemic, lessen the burden on developing country health systems, and speed up their economic recovery.In the implementation of COVID-19 vaccine efforts, CEPI will ensure that awardees addressing sex- and gender-based differences following the  WHO's 2016 Guidance for Managing Ethical Issues in Infectious Disease Outbreaks throughout the research and development process. / Le soutien du Canada à CEPI vise à aborder les COVID-19 défi par les pays en développement.

With already weak health systems and limited diagnostic capabilities, developing countries are particularly at risk of the outbreak spreading, potentially bearing a disproportionate share of the cost of the outbreak in terms of human suffering and economic impact. In addition, the disease and necessary containment measures will disproportionately harm the poor and other vulnerable groups in developing countries.

Poor access to services creates acute risks of insecurity for women and girls and denies them their dignity. The last decade, however, has seen concerted efforts to stem the deep inequality and exclusion in Nairobi's informal settlements. Special planning areas (SPAs) have emerged as a transformational model to spur redevelopment, first in the Mukuru area, with plans to replicate those efforts in the Kibera neighbourhood and the Mathare Valley. In Zambia, new urban-planning powers to create improvement areas and title urban properties offer promise to support large-scale redevelopment.   Building on those opportunities, this project will bring together grassroots movements, local authorities, universities, and civil society organizations to co-produce knowledge needed to foster inclusive and equitable change. In Nairobi, the project team will lead research to identify options for overcoming land tenure impediments to SPA processes in Kibera and Mathare. They will document ongoing support under the Mukuru SPA to apply emerging lessons across research sites. In Kitwe, Zambia, the project team will undertake a situational analysis that will serve as a basis for developing an integrated local area plan for the Ipusukilo settlement. Data collection across sites will involve strong participation of residents as part of larger efforts to place the urban poor at the centre of planning processes.   This project was selected for funding through a competitive call for proposals entitled Closing the justice gap - a legal empowerment research and learning agenda. The resulting cohort of projects will cover 12 country case studies in West Africa, East and Southern Africa, and Southeast Asia, and include a regional hub for each of those sub-regions.",10,,1,0,2,,0,0,0,0,1,,,,0,0,0,0,2021-08-12,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,

At the supply chain's marketing level, the Project's third output is putting into effect grading and marketing regulations, a joint venture established by the Government with an internationally recognized cotton classification organization, and bonding warehousing of cotton following international standards. To support the delivery of the outputs, an effective Common Center for Project Management will be established.",,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-12-31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Para ello se van a construir 67 viviendas básicas de 290 pies2 compuestas por salón, dormitorio, cocina y aseo de modo que las familias beneficiarias podrán disponer de espacio para el desarrollo de las diferentes actividades. Se realizarán en materiales perdurables, proporcionando protección y seguridad. Se han diseñado 4 modelos con lasmismas características, con diferente distribución, para que cada familia seleccione la que más se juste a sus necesidades culturales.La metodología a emplear para el desarrollo del proyecto es la de autoconstrucción de viviendas por parte de las titulares de derechos, de modo que sean ellas las principales actrices de su desarrollo. Para ello se realizarán talleres de formación teórica en la que se les enseñara albañilería, fontanería, elaboración de ladrillos y carpintería y mediante la construcción de las 67 viviendas obtendrán la capacitación práctica.La contraparte local CESSS trabaja desde hace varios años a favor de la organización comunitaria, lo que hace que parte del trabajo de organización de la comunidad ya este realizado. Así mismo las comunidades se verán fortalecidas al ser necesario el trabajo en equipo para la obtención del resultado esperado, las viviendas.La combinación de la teoría y la práctica tiene por objeto el ampliar las posibilidades laborales de este colectivo de modo que a largo plazo se pueda producir una mejora en la calidad de vida de las familias. A esto hemos de añadir que, una vez finalizado el proyecto, la máquina de elaboración de ladrillo serágestionada por el grupo de mujeres tribales PAZHANGUDI IRULAR MAGALIR KUZHU con el fin de que puedan ampliar y diversificar sus actividades económicas lo que les va a asegurar ingresos mensuales.El objetivo a corto plazo es poder proporcionar una vivienda digna a estas familias lo que repercutirá directamente en su calidad de vida e indirectamente en su autoestima y favorecerá las relacionesfamiliares, así como capacitar a la población para que puedan ser empleados como mano de obra en construcción y así proporcionarles un medio de vida que asegure unos ingresos a sus familias.Una característica innovadora es que los terrenos en el que se van a construir las viviendas están a nombre de las mujeres, lo que implica que una vez completadas estas queden a nombre de ellas favoreciendo así sudesarrollo y garantizándoles un espacio digno y seguro para vivir.",11.1,,2,1,1,,0,0,0,0,1,,1,,0,0,0,0,2020-09-25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UNOPS also provides administrative and operational services to many programs and projects under the UN system. UNOPS builds development-friendly infrastructure in developing countries provides procurement expertise to developing countries and manages projects and programs while enhancing developing countries' own project management capabilities.Cooperation between Finland and UNOPS intensified significantly during 2019. Earlier in 2019 Finland responded positively to the UNOPS inquiry about Finland's interest in hosting the UNOPS Sustainable Infrastructure Impact Investments (S3I) program. Already at this stage Finland also expressed its readiness for the necessary financial commitment in its capacity as the host country.Following negotiations Finland and UNOPS signed the host country agreement on 12 August 2019 which entered into force on 19 January 2020. The Helsinki S3I Program Office officially began its work on 1.3.2020 and its operations will be significantly expanded in the future. In addition to the S3I program the UNOPS Global Innovation and Technology Program will move to Finland.The UN estimates that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will require investments of around $ 4000 billion annually in developing countries. ODA can only cover a fraction of the amount. With $ 2500 billion in new investment needed each year it will inevitably also require private capital. This requires innovative financing solutions. The UNOPS impact investment program has established itself as an important vehicle for channeling private investments to developing countries, at the same time it helps meet critical national needs for affordable housing and renewable energy. The S3I is playing an increasingly important role in financing the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.Through S3I UNOPS has so far committed to e.g. building more than 860000 homes in Kenya Ghana India Pakistan and the Caribbean. In doing so the program will have a tangible positive impact on the lives of ordinary people while providing hundreds of thousands of local jobs and supporting a sustainable local economy. The program contributes in many ways to sustainable development objectives.","9.1,7.2,6.a,11.1",,0,0,2,,0,1,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,2021-12-31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Central Africa (Democratic Republic of the Congo,Rwanda and Burundi) is a botanically highly diverse region housing around 11,000 species of floweringplants, 65% of which are woody. In tropical Africa, 35% of all plant species are threatened while another33% can be considered rare. Their conservation and sustainable use is seriously hindered by insufficientfloristic data and tools to identify the species concerned. The Flore d'Afrique centrale is a majorundertaking providing such data and tools. It started already back in 1948, but today only 55% of thespecies have been dealt with. The Botanic Garden Meise has recently started up an ambitious plan tofinish the Flore d'Afrique centrale series within 15 years, with a growing international network of 45experts. The renewed activities are gaining momentum, 14 publications dealing with 116 species havebeen produced, and important digitization activities take place. But, to reach the goal promising Africanbotanists must receive training and foreign specialists must be able to visit the herbarium facilities ofBotanic Garden Meise for longer periods. The total budget for the first five years of the 15-yearundertaking is € 1.25 million. -  Specific objective: Summarizing the above, the first 5-year phase of the Flore d'Afrique centrale program will realize: -- - training of 5 African botanists, each during two visits of three months to the Meise facilities (c. -- 50% paid by Franklinia), -- - around 775 visiting days to the Meise facilities by around 30 international experts to prepare -- family treatments (c. 50% paid by Franklinia), -- - published treatments of about 1000 plant species, including identification tools, -- - an estimated 100 detailed botanical illustrations to assist the identification process, -- - an open access e-Flora platform providing information on an estimated 7000 Central African -- plant species, including the above-mentioned new treatments, -- - five annual Board Meetings to evaluate progress and directions of the program. -","15,14,11",,0,2,,,0,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2021-12-31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Dutch Government and the delta city of Beira agreed to enter into a medium term partnership to enhance the city's resilience to flooding and assist it to adapt to climate change. In a participatory process, a plan was developed which was adopted by the City council in 2014, the Beira Masterplan. Part of the plan was a list of priority projects among which the development of the Maraza New Town Area. Maraza is an undeveloped swamp area of 350 ha inside the city of Beira. The Maraza pilot project envisages to prove that through organized extension of residential areas, suitable land can be made available to end users for affordable prices in areas which are currently inhabitable due to regular flooding. The Municipality of Beira will establish a mechanism to or-ganize this: the Land Development Company (LDC)- an au-tonomous entity that will raise, level and drain terrains to reach economies of scale. In the statutes of the LDCs it is stipulated that all revenues are returning to the LDC and that part of the area will be used for social housing. With the pro-posed EKN contribution and an equivalent contribution of the municipality of Beira a pilot will be carried out to create a ' fly wheel effect' for the business case. An area of 3 hec-tares will be landfilled, 125 plots delineated and granted with secured land rights as well as basic infrastructure (ac-cess roads, utilities, drainage system). The British social investor REALL will be the launching cus-tomer. After scaling up the number of houses, it will be-come possible to build houses in the range of USD 10.000 per unit, giving the lower income groups an alternative to the present situation of forced habitation in flood prone are-as.",,,0,0,0,,0,0,,,,1,1,,0,0,2,0,2021-02-09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Customary laws and practices negatively impact on women's access to land and con­tinue to discriminate against women particularly in rural areas. Education accessibility for girls is affected by the unequal di­ vide between public and private education due to  inequitable resource distribution to public schools and the legacy of apartheids structural impact on the quality of public education in lower income areas and rural communities. Learner drop-out rates are high which exacerbates poverty and inequality, vul­nerability to gender-based violence and economic explo itation of women and girls. The overall aim of the project is: 1) To advance women's security of tenure and other property rights, and 2) to reduce barriers in accessing education for learners from poor and low-income  communities, LGBTI and girl learners. Objectives: 1. Promoting equitable land distribution to vulnerable groups, particularly women 2. Promote equal rights and access to land for those especially women -  inside and outside land administered by traditional leadership 3. Reducing the  barriers faced by LGBTI and girl learners when accessing education, on the basis of multiple and intersecting factors specifically race, poverty violence, sexual orientation and socio-economic status. 4. Challenging laws and policies that block learner access to data, technology, and the internet in public schools, 72% of which had no internet access as of  2018. This project is linked to  previously  funded  programmes related to women's equal rights, gender based violence and sexual vio­ lence in schools.   The actions in the proposal address the  need for  inclusiveness of access to  education for girls, equitable edu­ cation in the public school system.  The focus will be on address­ ing  the  systemic  issues  such  as discriminatory  barriers in  law and legislation that contribute to inequity and discrimination on the basis of gender. The project  builds on the LRC's previous programmatic work aimed at reducing discriminatory systemic factors that contribute  to  women's poverty, including  violence against  and exclusion of women and girls in accessing  resources such as land, housing, and  education,  LGBTI rights and Internet and data rights.",,,0,0,2,,0,0,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,2021-12-31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its mandate is to develop and manage urban water supply systems in 130 small towns and urban sanitation in all 151 towns in Mozambique. This activity is a continuation of the first two phases and will be implemented in 75 towns. For water supply, 50 towns of the first two phases will be supported plus 25 additional towns, for sanitation, 24 towns from the first two phases will be supported plus 21 additional towns. The activity runs from 1 January 2021 until 31 December 2025, with a total contribution of EUR 21.150.000. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, EUR 3.150.000 of the budget is made available for investments in school sanitation in 2021. The overall objective of this activity is to increase access to sustainable water and sanitation services in small towns in Mozambique. In addition to the continued support under the previous programs (345.000 beneficiaries for water and 300.000 beneficiaries for sani tation, to be verified through the PO75 baseline), the activity proposed is expected to reach 157.000 additional people served with water and 186.000 additional people served with sanitation. The latter includes the investments in water and sanitation in schools mentioned above, with an estimated 58.500 beneficiaries. The project composes of four work packages which will generate the following outcomes: 1. A stable AIAS organization at central and provincial level with a capacity to guarantee sustainability of services to attract more funding from third parties. 2. Sustainable operation of urban drinking water and sanitation services in 75 towns under the mandate of AIAS. 3. Investments have been made in the upgrading and rehabilitation of water and sanitation facilities under the mandate of AIAS. 4. An enabling environment has been established to foster smart connection financing and smart water networks to support public and private water operators. The activity includes technical assistance by a consortium of Dutch partners (VEI, SNV, BZRD).

The tectonic collision of the Earth's plates is creating huge mountains in this region. These mountains are created from earthquakes on large faults along the northern Tien Shan mountain range. Kyrgyzstan's' capital, Bishkek, lies on top of one of these major fault lines and is home to a million people. In the past, major cities that exist along the northern edge of this mountain range, such as Almaty to the east, have been destroyed in large earthquakes at the end of the 19th Century. This occurred when they were relatively small towns. The impact today from similar sized earthquakes would have a much more devastating effect if it were to strike the major city of Bishkek. The rapid expansion of cities in poorer countries has meant that a large number of buildings are not strong enough to be resilient to earthquakes.  We want to help the Government ministries in Bishkek, such as the Ministry for Construction and also for Emergency Situations, to be able to better assess the potential impact for earthquakes to strike the city in future. We will do this by providing them with estimates of how many people may die in future earthquakes, how many buildings will be damaged or collapse, and how much such an earthquake will cost financially. We will also provide maps of where we think the city will be most affected by different types of earthquakes, as small nearby earthquakes can have as big an impact as distant large ones. This will enable the Kyrgyz government ministries to target where in the city key buildings, such as schools and hospitals, should be reinforced, as well as to better plan where new housing estates should be built, and also to enforce the seismic building codes to make sure the buildings are built better.  In order to provide this latest information, we will be working with the Institute of Seismology in Bishkek, whose responsibility it is to provide these kinds of estimates of seismic risk. We are therefore working directly with the organisation that has the mandate to provide information to the government and by doing so we will ensure that our work will also have an impact. We are also going to train the institute staff to be able to update these estimates of losses so that they have the capacity to continue this work once we are no longer working on this project.  It is important to be able to keep updating the estimates of losses and maps of seismic risk. Cities are constantly enlarging. If these cities lie in earthquake prone areas, such as the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek, this growth increases their exposure to seismic hazards, increasing the risk that people face. Often some of the best views over a city come from higher ground, but this high ground is created by faults that build mountains. The city of Bishkek is expanding southwards as the urban population grows, and homes are now being built right on top of these fault lines.

Waste management is, however, a complex area, which affects multiple stakeholders, such as manufacturers, distributors, retailers, households, the recycling industry, informal waste pickers and local governments, and therefore requires an integrated approach.   Malawi and Tanzania are two of the world's poorest countries, yet the consumption of plastics has exploded in the last decade. Tanzania and Malawi make important case-study countries because of their recent governmental responses to plastic bags, and their contrasting policy landscapes in terms of tackling plastic wastes. In many cities in sub-Saharan Africa, plastic wastes, and plastic bags in particular, block urban drainage systems. During rain events this leads to localised flooding, with an increased risk of human exposure to raw sewage and the spread of waterborne pathogens within highly populated areas. Plastic waste can also act as a transient receptacle for rainwater and thus provide a larval habitat for mosquitoes. Therefore, the negative impacts of plastic pollution on human health can include the spread of pathogens such as cholera and typhoid, and the provision of transient receptacles for breeding mosquitoes that can carry diseases such as malaria and Zika virus. In parallel, the consequences of living with significant levels of environmental plastic pollution can negatively affect mental health and well-being. However, despite wide-scale recognition of the need for LMIC governments to invest more thoroughly in solid waste management, this remains a low funding priority area, with fragmented responsibility between departments and a lack of time or technical expertise to negotiate suitable waste management strategies. Typically, governments, communities and individuals in sub-Saharan countries prioritise health-care, and food and water security, followed by employment, education and housing. Plastic pollution rarely registers as something important enough to re-direct valuable resources away from these more pressing challenges. However, we argue that waste management is inextricably linked to health and should not be treated as a separate issue. By characterising how people interact with plastics on a day-by-day basis, the SPACES project will provide the framework needed to build circular economies with improved, more sustainable development pathways and new economic opportunities, and have far-reaching implications for human health and well-being, ecosystem services and economic stability in sub-Saharan Africa and beyond.  Quantitative and qualitative mixed methods approaches will be developed to understand what socioeconomic and political obstacles exist for incentivising governments to remove plastic waste and increase sustainable waste disposal.

More than 80% of malaria is transmitted indoors at night, so the number of malaria mosquitoes which enter a house is critical for getting the disease - with people living in 'leaky' houses being at most risk. We have shown that closing the eaves (the gap between the top of the wall and the roof) and screening a house can reduce dramatically the number of malaria vectors entering a house. Here we propose to find out whether we can protect children against malaria by modifying half the study houses so that they (1) have a metal roof, (2) closed eaves, (3) screened doors and windows and (4) screened-air bricks which allow the warm air to rise out of the house, but not let any mosquitoes indoors. The other study houses will be left with thatched roofs and open eaves and the children in these houses will serve as a comparison group.  Over the past thirty years a silent revolution in house design has been happening across Africa. The traditional thatched-roofed houses are being replaced steadily by metal-roofed houses as the continent develops. We hope to ride this wave of cultural change and further improve the design of houses to make them healthier to live in.

Europe and India are, in effect, two interesting environments in which to perform such an appraisal. Both are indeed major players in the globalized world to the production of which they contribute about 25%. Europe is made of mature economies with virtually zero extreme poverty (as defined by the income threshold of 1.7 US dollar a day in purchasing power parity) that exhibits modest yearly per capita growth and slow structural changes. India is by contrast a fast-growing developing country that concentrates one third of the world's extremely poor population and that is changing its social organization at an unprecedented pace. In so far as income and wealth inequality are concerned, the European countries are facing the challenge of sharing a mildly growing per capita GDP. By contrast, India faces the challenge of sharing the spectacular growth among the various segment of its population, including the extremely poor. But inequalities in income, consumption or wealth are by no means the only dimension by which individuals differ. Inequalities in variables such as health, education or access to decent housing are also extremely important in this perspective. So are the more subtle inequalities in social status, or the inequalities of opportunities that individuals coming from various groups are facing. Europe and India are interesting laboratories to analyze all these inequalities also because of the different attitude that their population seem to have with respect to these inequalities. The ethical acceptability of the different inequalities is an extremely important factor that seem to differ somewhat between India and Europe and, for that matter, even between European countries themselves. For example, there is a widespread view in European countries of protestant culture that income inequalities which result purely from a different exertion of effort are not ethically objectionable. This view seems to be less prevalent in countries of catholic culture. Similarly, India, with its still prevailing caste system, is often perceived as being more tolerant to inequalities in social status than Europe. The proposed research will make several contributions to our understanding of the inequalities in Europe in India. The first one will be to provide new tools for appraising some of these inequalities that are both easy to apply and based on clear ethical premises. Some of these tools concern inequalities in variables such as social status, education or access to a decent housing that can not be easily measured on a cardinal scale. For such variables, the conventional tools for measuring income or wealth inequalities can not be meaningfully applied.

Consequently, the majority of the population depend on government to provide housing. Many of these houses have failed and continue to fail meeting expected life span. The problem is, to some extent, linked to improper foundation design due to location and soil type the houses are built on. With lack of regularisation of land tenure, the authorities are forced to offer plots on low lying areas which are dominated by shrinking-swelling clays - abundant in southern Africa - globally known as a major cause of damage to light engineering structures by exhibiting significant volume change in response to changes in soil water content. The calcareous nature of expansive clays in South Africa has also led to high spatial variability of physicomechanical properties, which has made the use of standard testing and design procedures challenging. Adoption of more reliable, rapid, inexpensive and bespoke testing methods – tripod partnership (industry, academia, and policy-makers) - will benefit from performance-based design and lower maintenance cost of buildings and critical infrastructures across South Africa. This project will expand the RAEng TASMIP technology that offered a reproducible consistency index parameter (liquid limit - LL) for highly variable expansive clays and silts. The aim is to verify the modified technology through testing on a wider range of samples from as many different regions of SA, before submission in form of a policy paper.

This is posing a remarkable challenge to the government's attempts to provide affordable housing for South Africa's growing population as quickly and economically as needed. Design of foundations for most light structures in South Africa, and particularly for low-cost housing, relies heavily on determination of index parameters (i.e. Atterberg Limits). The tests for these properties are currently performed in commercial materials testing laboratories using the procedures of the CSIR's Technical Methods for Highways Part 1 TMH1 (CSIR 1986). SANS 3001-GR10/11/12:2013 1.2 is being phased in to replace TMH1. The TMH1 and SANS 3001 codes may be adequate for simply identifying materials so plastic that they must be rejected as road subgrade or given special treatment. The two codes appear not to be fit for accurate determination of index parameters (i.e. liquid and plastic limits), thereby having serious shortcomings in the context of foundation design for light structures. An inaccurate measurement of index parameters leads to inaccurate estimation of swelling-shrinkage potential/pressure and a scope for foundations to be distressed during or shortly after construction. Through a collaborative experimental programme and an industry-academia partnership, the proposed project here will work towards the adoption of Cone Penetrometer test (standardised by BSi) for determination of liquid limit of the South African highly plastic clays, and also the refinement of test procedure to extend its use to plasticity limit determination.",4.3,,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,1,,,,0,0,0,0,2021-01-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the recognition of unpaid work or free-time (leisure) through time-use statistics or its effect on people's mental and physical wellbeing remains unexplored. Hence, my PhD project aims to collect the time-use data of older adults across class, gender and age, residing in urban spaces. In the process, I will critically interrogate the socio-cultural meanings of free-time and household division of affective labour (unpaid care work and domestic chores) which leads to time-poverty among older women.  Moreover, the emerging consumerist lifestyle shape the lives of older middle to upper middle-class Indians and provide recent evidence that these later lives are increasingly governed by emerging medical and technological advancements, anti-aging industry, and consumerist pursuits (like travel, luxury housing or cosmetic procedures). These changes in experiences and perceptions of aging and later-life stages will also allow me to address the questions on time poverty, gender inequality and household division of labour among the older populations. This will be studied by collecting data on time-use patterns of older adults - dedicated to learning how people allocate their time throughout an average day. Specifically from this placement, I aim to learn and specialise in time-use studies which includes diary entries, activity coding & classification and analysing the data through statistical modelling. Also, I aim to collect data from the Indian diaspora to record the cultural variability of free-time activities. The diaspora community will allow me to elaborate (i) if Indian diaspora in the UK manage time different than those back in India, (ii) if the change in cultural context change the way people understand questions of equality and gender roles, (iii) does living in a developed nation democratise ideals around gender? The empirical time-use data from this project, will help me elucidate on broader empirical questions, of older adults' health, wellbeing and gender equality through leisure and labour practices within households.",4.3,,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,1,,,,0,0,0,0,2021-01-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Globally, forced displacement levels are hitting a record modern-day high. UNHCR reports 65.3 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict and persecution in 2015. Every minute, on average 24 people were forced to flee somewhere in the world, and these levels were four times higher than a decade prior. 2015 also marked a watershed moment in Europe, with hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees arriving on its shores, after often perilous journeys. In India, cities grow rapidly, and continue to receive many people that are internally displaced due to agrarian crisis, conflict, development induced displacement and abject poverty.   Protracted displacement is now chiefly an urban affair. Cities offer economic and social opportunities, however, they can also be places of rising inequalities, deprivation, isolation and exploitation. The flow of displaced groups quickens urbanisation, and may create (actual or perceived) competition for jobs, quality housing and limited essential services such as health and education. The UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 sets out the global ambition for inclusive, sustainable and secure cities, and the New Urban Agenda (2016) explicitly calls for inclusion of urban refugees within existing city structures. Yet, India and European cities' efforts to manage inflows often face populist backlashes. Greater understanding is hence needed of the ways in which people succeed or fail to make urban spaces into places of belonging, participation and wellbeing in conditions of scarcity and growing urban inequality. This will require attention to the placemaking processes and practices that structure refugees' and forced migrants' political, social and economic citizenship, access to livelihood opportunities, connections with existing communities and, ultimately, to define and achieve a 'right to the city'.   This project offers new ways of cross-disciplinary thinking, methodological innovation and action. To this end, the project will adopt a mixed methods approach.

These are reusable skills that improve people's social welfare so have uses beyond computer science. Programming is now being introduced to primary school children using block-based programming tools to bypass the difficulty of high level programming languages. These tools allow children to drag code snippets and rearrange elements within a computer program. They are highly visual and highly interactive, allowing children to manipulate code and thereby develop computational thinking skills and creative thinking. Whilst such tools have been shown to be highly effective, they cannot be easily used by blind or visually impaired students as they are visually oriented. Therefore, the visual orientation of these tools is an obstacle for skill development for blind and visually impaired students. The aim of the project is to support economic development and enhance social welfare in Turkey through improving programming skills of blind or visually impaired children. Within this project, an instructional design will be developed, including learning materials and teacher training programme, to provide programming education for blind and visually impaired students.

The project will entail research in five of the world's largest refugee camps. Zaatari and Azraq (Jordan), Kilis (Turkey), Mae La (Thailand), Nyarugusu (Tanzania). These have populations of up to 250,000 and hence are in many ways cities. They have summer temperatures >35degC and occasionally >40degC, in these conditions un-insulated dwellings are unable to provide safe conditions. In addition, such locations can have 1600W/m2 of solar radiation, further raising the temperature inside a dwelling, and in the case of Jordan winter temperatures of -10degC. In Thailand the high humidity is likely to be of equal importance in placing thermal stress on occupants. In addition, displacement shelters can use polymeric materials which contain a high proportion of VOCs such as plasticisers and release agents, and have poorly ventilated cooking facilities using fuels such as wood, thereby generating particulates.   Camps were once expected to be a short term solution, and this is still true in some settings. However, as witnessed in numerous locations around the globe, encampment often continues for years or decades (for example, the 340,000 strong Dadaab camp in Kenya opened in 1992).  Even in natural disasters delays in rebuilding can lead to displacement camps taking on aspects of semi-permanent settlement. The challenges of survival in the immediate onset of an emergency quickly give way to concerns about the suitability of shelter over a longer timeframe. Such basic dwellings inhibit domestic life, educational delivery to the young, and development of the social relations needed for community cohesion. Often the need of traumatised people for a sense of security and privacy also goes unmet. Unfortunately, even the state of the art in current shelter provision does not adequately consider building physics, thermal comfort and air quality. There is also a general lack of attention to socio-cultural issues. Thus, for example, our pilot study in Jordan has revealed through social surveys a consistent concern amongst the displaced population with the issues of safety and privacy.   Given the diversity of potentially available building materials, climates and cultures, there will be no single shelter solution, but rather a need for a systematic process of design that is cognisant of the climate, landscape, culture, length of time the accommodation might be needed, flexibility as family size changes and portability. This project will develop such a design process by creating a new science of shelter design through engagement with aid agency staff in four countries with diverse weather, cultural conditions and political sensitivities. This will involve 1) wide scale social and indoor environment surveys in five camps, 2) the construction of a series of potential designs in the UK, in a c",9.5,,,,0,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,2021-01-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The largest inflow was to the Andean countries of Latin America: Colombia (1.3 million), Ecuador (220,000), Peru (635,000) and Chile (100,000). The ongoing political and constitutional conflict in Venezuela (Jan 2019-)  elevated the risk of this outflow being sustained, a mega-migration process driven by factors of expulsion rather than attraction (Michael Piore 1979).   This migratory process is unprecedented for Latin American countries, which have not developed adequate regional co-ordination mechanisms for addressing large scale hemispheric displacement. This capacity weakness is further reflected in the migrant flows from Central America to Mexico and the US, but with the Venezuela / Latin American migratory dynamic being significant due to the speed of the exodus. The 'tide of migrants' has put enormous pressures on receiving countries and revealed major weaknesses in technical and humanitarian responses that this project seeks to address.    All migration has a chain of processes for the migrant: the decision, the journey, the crossing of borders, the first contacts, the resettlement, the search for work and resocialization. This chain is difficult, but it is even more so when the migration is disruptive, as in this case, wherein the migrant risks loss of fundamental rights and protections, separation from family and other 'resilience' networks, and suffers new labour, income, gender and cultural inequalities. The tensions between Venezuela and neighbouring countries, and between Venezuelans and host communities further complicates the situation of migrants and exacerbates their vulnerabilities.   The speed, scale and context of migrant outflows has meant Venezuelans lack appropriate documentation, they do not have access to health, housing, education or social services and there has been elevated dependence on employment in poorly remunerated, informal and also criminal sectors (INEI, 2018, Baltica, Tunstall, Pickett and Gideon, 2013, Fundaredes 2018). There was consequently a mismatch in the social protection and health systems of receiving countries, which were not prepared to meet the urgent needs of this migrant population. While the Andean states have sought to address the new humanitarian and health challenge, and developed Initiatives to address this gap, a number of problems have arisen: provision has fueled resentment among populations in receiving countries, addressing migrant needs has highlighted existing deficiencies in technical and human capacity, and responses have been short term and emergency based. This has precluded co-operation and the sharing of best practice and lessons learned across Andean countries.    .  The aim of the Andean network project / proposal is to strengthen the responses of countries to this new problem of mass migration, through cooperative learning",9.5,,,,0,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,2021-01-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The greatest increases in non-communicable diseases are seen in low- and middle-income countries now experiencing epidemics of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Outdoor and indoor air pollution combined account for around 7 million of these deaths, predominantly in developing countries of Asia, particularly India and China. Environmental pollution affects everyone in society creating a heavy burden on quality of life, productivity and school performance. The underprivileged, including female and children, living and working in polluted environments are more at risk and unable to avoid exposure. Greenhouse gases emitted from the same sources (e.g. motorised transport, waste burning) have an impact on climate, increasing the risk of extreme weather events such as floods and heatwaves. Asian countries are urbanising rapidly and unsustainably, locking their populations in polluting behaviours through inefficient land use planning and poorly designed transport and housing infrastructure. Environmental pollution is a drain on development, disproportionately affecting underprivileged communities, for example those living in informal settlements, and vulnerable individuals, for example those with respiratory illness. For too long the relationship between prosperity and environment has been seen as a trade-off.  Tackling pollution was considered a handicap to economic growth. Growing evidence now shows sustainable development can help improve not only health and the environment, but also the economy.  The drive towards cleaner environments and low carbon development, provides a compelling opportunity to realise multiple societal benefits: to improve health and the environment, innovate and become more competitive. To address the huge development challenge of environmental pollution and non-communicable diseases in Asia, and harness opportunities provided by sustainable development, we propose the engagement network on Clean Environment and Planetary Health in Asia (CEPHA): to catalyse technological and societal innovation through deep engagement across disciplines and sectors that will stimulate transformative changes to business models, government policies and public health practice in Asia. Network outcomes will include long-lasting partnerships, enhanced knowledge exchange and capacity building, and co-creation of projects and resources focusing on actionable solutions to the challenges of improving the environment, decarbonising the economy, and reducing the burden on non-communicable diseases in Asia.

Today global health focuses on water and sanitation, but there is comparatively little research done on housing and health. This is a missed opportunity, since many important diseases transmitted by insects, occur indoors or around the home. The goal of this Network is to make communities in sub-Saharan Africa more resilient to the threat from insect-transmitted diseases, chiefly malaria, a rural disease, and diseases carried by Aedes species mosquitoes, like Zika and dengue, which are primarily urban diseases. To achieve this goal we need to find new solutions to stop mosquitoes entering houses and, for Aedes-borne diseases, to reduce the aquatic habitats in towns and cities. Whilst this may sound common sense, despite repeated attempts, we have been singularly unsuccessful in bring together experts in insect-transmitted diseases and the built environment over the past 50 years. There is an even greater necessity to break down these silos today since the World Health Organisation will launch its global strategy on the control of insect-transmitted diseases in May 2017 which advocates for the need to control vector-borne diseases by experts in vector-borne diseases working alongside those in the built environment.  The BOVA Network, if funded, would be in the vanguard of this new strategy helping to protect communities in sub-Saharan Africa from these major insect-borne diseases. The Management Board that will run the Network is an extremely diverse group with experts on insect-transmitted diseases, architecture, civil engineering, town planning, development, product development, industry, health economics and community participation, from sub-Saharan Africa and developed countries. This exceptional pool of talent will allow us to link-up with larger groups of experts and the Network grant will provide the springboard for us to grow a new scientific discipline. Specifically the Network will: 1) facilitate the exchange of information about insect-transmitted diseases and the built environment between disciplines, 2) fund basic and applied research to develop and scale-up products and novel approaches to reducing the threat from insect-transmitted diseases in the built environment, 3) help build the next generation of scientists, architects, engineers and planners developing approaches to the control of these diseases and 4) to reach out to funders and those engaged in development projects, like United Nations organisations and the Development Banks to invest in the control of vector-borne diseases through the built environment.

One in three urban dewllers, and an estimated 881 million people in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) now live in informal settlements, colloquially known as 'slums', where they have inadequate, insecure housing and limited services. These settlements are often the only option for people working in the informal sector, and existing evidence shows that residents are often highly resourceful, resilient and innovative in navigating the problems they face daily.  However, they also face challenges that appear intractable:  multiple health and well-being risks and vulnerabilities, related to an unhealthy environment, insecurity and social marginalisation.  Informal urban settlements are rapidly changing, with in and out-migration and shifts in social norms, as well as being economically and socially unequal.  Failures to provide services, infrastructure and mechanisms for redress by national and local governments are often linked to the presence of multiple actors and organisations including non-governmental, private and criminal organisations. These conditions can act as an incubator for various forms of violence (e.g. political and gender-based), which threaten well-being.    Our Hub will work with the most marginalised dwellers in informal urban settlements, including through federations of 'Slum/ Shack Dwellers', linked to Hub partner SDI. We will support them in identifying their priorities, making their conditions visible to key service providers related to health (both governmental and non-governmental) across a range of sectors, and working with identified allies amongst these actors to develop better mechanisms for accountability and more responsive services.  We will test this approach to addressing this intractable challenge, and pilot the priority interventions developed.  Many conventional research methods and routine information systems are ill-suited to these complex and rapidly changing contexts and are not sufficiently linked to action. We will use innovative participatory methods, including analysis of data collected by informal urban dwellers themselves, to gain a deep understanding of health risks, vulnerabilities, and priorities and service access barriers. We will bring insights from a range of disciplines including social and political sciences and epidemiology to develop innovative metrics that can better reflect these realities and inform policy and practice development and evaluation.  Learning and data from these innovative approaches and methodologies will be brought together to form a tested set of methodologies that identify promising mechanisms for improving accountability and service responsiveness to promote health and well-being for the most marginalised.

The destruction of housing is often most visible, and the most devastating to the families, with often hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed. Householders themselves are invariably the first to respond, they are never passive, and signs of shelter recovery are very apparent from the first days after a disaster. The majority - as many as 80 or 90% - receive little or no assistance from the international community and are the main drivers of their own recovery process. This process has been termed 'self-recovery'. Previous GCRF awards supported interdisciplinary teams led by ODI in collaboration with CARE International UK, BGS, UCL and Loughborough University. They developed the understanding of the self-recovery process and advanced the theoretical basis for humanitarian assistance to the process of supporting self-recovery in practice. In large part as a result of this work, self-recovery is now a strategic element of the humanitarian shelter sector discourse with many disaster responses purporting to support this inevitable process. In recognition of the value of a people-centred approach that moves away from the convention product-based modalities, the CARE Philippines post-cyclone self-recovery project won the 2018 World Habitat Award in acknowledgment of its self-recovery focus. Sixteen thousand houses were built, each one unique and reflecting the priorities and means of each family. https://www.world-habitat.org/world-habitat-awards/winners-and-finalists/post-haiyan-self-recovery-housing-programme/ The self-recovery approach that respects the primacy of agency and choice aligns well with current humanitarian and development concerns such as the 'humanitarian development nexus', the Grand Bargain's emphasis on localisation, participation and cash-based responses, the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Global Shelter Cluster strategy. This is further explained in the Business Case. However, very little has been done to develop guidance for practice. With the exception of the protocol 'Informing Choice for Better Shelter' that delivers a guide for the development of technical educational material, there are no published tools nor guidelines that provide an implementation framework for self-recovery in shelter projects. This project addresses this gap. CARE International has over 70 country offices across the world, all of them in ODA eligible  countries.

Thus, besides limited humanitarian aid, Dominicans survived Maria by improvising meals from stockpiled food, assembling work crews to clear debris, telling cathartic stories to ease stress and using remittances to rebuild homes. They survived, through social modes of resilience.  Months later, the government vowed to make Dominica -the most mountainous island in the region with perhaps the greatest number of environmental hazards per square mile - the 'first climate resilient nation on earth', launching the Climate Resilience Execution Agency of Dominica (CREAD) and a 'National Resilience Development Strategy' (aligned to the UN 2030 Sustainable Development and Sendai agendas) to 'climate proof' the island's housing, infrastructure, energy and tourism sectors. Yet, despite this macroscale 'resilience turn', very little is known about the micro - individual, household and community level - adaptations that enabled Dominicans to survive Maria, Erika (2015) and earlier storms. Nor is there a critical high-level conversation what this ubiquitous term, 'resilience', means to everyday Dominicans - notably marginalized groups (Dominican youth, female farmers, indigenous people and displaced communities).  Towards creating a more inclusive understanding of cyclone preparation, response and recovery, the CCC project will develop collaborative methodologies that explore lived understandings of what 'building back better' might mean in local terms. This multi-disciplinary approach to such 'vernacular resiliencies' is intended to complement and critically enhance the CREAD agenda, holistically mapping survivor-led recoveries - past, present and future. But why mapping? We believe maps do not simply represent the world, they guide our experience of it.   We will investigate and visually map cyclone resilience 'from below' by using the following research methods:  - Oral, archival and architectural enquiry into hurricane histories. - Contemporary community-led digital storytelling and ethnography of life and livelihoods after Maria (with an emphasis on marginalized experiences). - Citizen-led GIS survey and cartographies of hazards, shelters and response agencies across the island.  The research will produce the following outputs:  An online hurricane 'resilience' map of Dominica - documenting historic and recent storm recoveries, and plotting hazard sites, shelters and support agencies to reduce future risks to wellbeing.

Insecure and informal access to energy impacts on all aspects of life for poor communities living in sub-standard housing in the global South. Access to affordable, reliable and safe forms of energy services has particularly profound effects on health and economic opportunities. However, the ways in which these communities access and use energy in their day-to-day lives are poorly understood. The ways in which those practices change when informal settlements are upgraded or relocated are equally poorly understood.  As data-driven approaches to energy planning, such as Urban Building Energy Models (UBEMs), gain increasing importance as planning tools, this lack of understanding risks further marginalising the most vulnerable communities as their needs are either entirely overlooked or planned solutions fail to address their needs. UBEMs have been developed in, and widely applied to, cities in the global North to model urban energy consumption on a building by building basis, allowing the assessment of impacts of different energy conservation measures and policies. Such tools are highly attractive to energy planners in the global South, but the complexity of informal settlements is wholly absent from these models at present.    GEMDev will use participatory research methods to co-create datasets with marginalised communities to ensure that they are represented in the UBEMs of the future. Engaging these communities in the creation of the knowledge and datasets in order to represent them in energy planning tools is a highly novel approach which not only ensures meaningful recognition, but, through the research process itself, increases communities' capacity and skills, amplifying their voice in the planning processes that have profound impacts on their lives.  Lima and Ahmedabad have been selected as the cases for application of the GEMDev project for both methodological and practical reasons. From a methodological perspective, both are global cities characterised by significant inequalities in access to energy and other services but with very different histories of development and policies for addressing the needs of the urban poor. From a practical perspective, we will build on strong existing research partnerships in both cities. The UCL/FCPV partnership in Lima contributes expertise in participatory methods and strong engagement with municipal authorities, while capacity in building energy modelling will be built through an innovative approach between private and public universities, PUCP and UNI.

Europe and India are, in effect, two interesting environments in which to perform such an appraisal. Both are indeed major players in the globalized world to the production of which they contribute about 25%. Europe is made of mature economies with virtually zero extreme poverty (as defined by the income threshold of 1.7 US dollar a day in purchasing power parity) that exhibits modest yearly per capita growth and slow structural changes. India is by contrast a fast-growing developing country that concentrates one third of the world's extremely poor population and that is changing its social organization at an unprecedented pace. In so far as income and wealth inequality are concerned, the European countries are facing the challenge of sharing a mildly growing per capita GDP. By contrast, India faces the challenge of sharing the spectacular growth among the various segment of its population, including the extremely poor. But inequalities in income, consumption or wealth are by no means the only dimension by which individuals differ. Inequalities in variables such as health, education or access to decent housing are also extremely important in this perspective. So are the more subtle inequalities in social status, or the inequalities of opportunities that individuals coming from various groups are facing. Europe and India are interesting laboratories to analyze all these inequalities also because of the different attitude that their population seem to have with respect to these inequalities. The ethical acceptability of the different inequalities is an extremely important factor that seem to differ somewhat between India and Europe and, for that matter, even between European countries themselves. For example, there is a widespread view in European countries of protestant culture that income inequalities which result purely from a different exertion of effort are not ethically objectionable. This view seems to be less prevalent in countries of catholic culture. Similarly, India, with its still prevailing caste system, is often perceived as being more tolerant to inequalities in social status than Europe. The proposed research will make several contributions to our understanding of the inequalities in Europe in India. The first one will be to provide new tools for appraising some of these inequalities that are both easy to apply and based on clear ethical premises. Some of these tools concern inequalities in variables such as social status, education or access to a decent housing that can not be easily measured on a cardinal scale. For such variables, the conventional tools for measuring income or wealth inequalities can not be meaningfully applied.

The majority of refugees in the world have been in these situations for more than five years, a threshold usually referred to as 'protracted'. As crises become prolonged, the limitations of the humanitarian response have long been recognised as insufficient and inadequate. Refugees and Internally Displaced People caught up in these protracted situations often speak of watching their lives 'draining away'. The model of support offered to displaced people is known by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) as 'care and maintenance' but perhaps more accurately by advocates of a radical change to this policy as the 'warehousing' of refugees. Global policy interest is shifting from short term humanitarianism to longer term development focused responses to protracted displacement. This was most recently indicated by the Global Compact on Refugees, in December 2018. The Refugee Compact introduces positive language around the long-term self reliance of refugees. This project responds to this renewed political will to find new solutions to protracted displacement and builds on a large body of research and advocacy work in this area. The project investigates the replacement of the care and maintenance model with a new approach: the protracted displacement economy.  The protracted displacement economy introduces two key innovations that will contribute to this original analysis as well the potential for impact. First, it is a whole of society approach. The focus is not just on displaced people but the 'displacement affected community', that includes the heterogeneous 'host' population, amongst others. The second key innovation is a fundamental shift in the understanding of the transactions that drive the protracted displacement economy. Financial transactions are the stuff of most economic analysis, yet key human interactions and exchanges or gifts, collective organisation, care work and mutual aid are largely non-financial.  Research will involve ten countries, five pairs of countries each separated by an international border: The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)/Uganda, Ethiopia/Somalia, Lebanon/Syria, Myanmar/Thailand, Pakistan/Afghanistan.These ten countries encompass the most serious protracted displacement crises in the world. Research will be conducted with partners in one of each pair of countries and will be attentive to the cross-border dynamics of the protracted displacement economy. International partners are: The University of Kinshasa (DRC), The University of Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), the NGOs Basmeh & Zeitooneh and Sawa (Lebanon), the think tank Covenant Institute (Myanmar) and the University of Peshawar (Pakistan).

International agreements, such as UN Habitat's New Urban Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals seek to ensure that this growth in as inclusive as possible, yet cities are notoriously unequal places. Our previous GCRF-funded research ('The Unknown City') highlighted the overwhelming significance of securing housing tenure for the most marginal urban residents. The possibility of eviction hangs heavily over everyday life and wellbeing for the urban poor.  This project builds on that work. Security of tenure both shapes and is shaped by state decisions to extend infrastructure to 'off grid' settlements. Extending infrastructure can be part of legalising trajectories towards housing security, but can also reverse such trajectories for some by producing new exclusions. This project seeks to bring greater clarity to this complexity and identify ways in which infrastructure for the most marginalised can initiate 'trajectories of inclusion'. The project is designed as action research in which the ultimate goal is a supported intervention in marginalised urban neighbourhood with the aim of implementing findings around these trajectories of inclusion for poor urban residents. The effects of this intervention will be carefully evaluated during the project and the results will be widely communicated.   Research builds on the Unknown City project, working in the same cities with the same partners with whom successful collaborations are now well established. The project will focus on two sites from that project in each city in order to develop longer term data sets but it introduces four new neighbourhoods in each country and develops very different approaches, including the central objective of the intervention. Research will be conducted in three countries: Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe and the independent but unrecognised northern region of Somalia, Somaliland.

All four cities are expanding rapidly and are the subject of major urban redevelopment programmes. The project involves core partner academic organisations in each city engaged in research and evaluation of these redevelopment programmes. In addition to two neighbourhoods involved in previous research, research will expand to two additional contrasting neighbourhoods in the capital and two further neighbourhoods in a secondary city in order to highlight if the capitals are unusual in their planning approaches.

The UN's 'Cooling for All' coalition estimates that 1.1 billion people worldwide have little or no access to cooling to protect them against extreme heat .  Those defined as most at risk include 630 million people across South Asia, South East Asia and Sub Saharan Africa who live in poor quality housing on low incomes, with limited, intermittent or insecure access to electricity and few if any electrical cooling appliances. Current global and national frameworks for action on heat in global cities categorise the negative effects of heat on these urban residents as either a public health issue (i.e. leading to heat illness, dehydration and disease) or an economic issue (i.e. leading to a decline in employment, worker productivity and output). Yet this categorisation significantly limits the way that frameworks for action on heat account for socio-economic inequality and gender.  In some countries, like India and Pakistan, international and national frameworks for responding to extreme heat in cities have led to urban heat action plans and public awareness raising. However, action on overheating by city planners and policy makers remains typically top-down and technology driven, frequently challenged by silo-ed agendas, unexamined assumptions about energy cultures and practices, and the vulnerabilities of the poorest groups. There have been no systematic, comparative attempts to document how people living in contexts of urban poverty manage heat or meet their needs for cool food, water and space. As a result, there is little evidence about whether current strategies are a good fit for the contexts in which they are deployed.     Over 36 months, this project will put 'access to cooling' at the centre of a major new interdisciplinary and comparative study of human-infrastructure interactions in 'the off-grid city'. The projected effects of 2-4 degrees C global heating on cities make the impact of uneven grids for energy, water and transportation on cool infrastructures and practices an urgent arena for scholarship. Against this backdrop, human-centred approaches to the study of energy infrastructures have the potential to make a major contribution to action on overheating by transforming the way cooling needs and capacities are understood at the global, national and city level, by establishing cooling as social as well as technical, and by promoting sustainable interventions.   Our research will take place in four cities - Hyderabad (India), Karachi (Pakistan), Yaoundé (Cameroon) and Jakarta (Indonesia) - enabling us to develop the first globally comparative study of cool infrastructures across the Global South.

Yet these years have seen the deepening of the urban pathologies that such efforts hoped to redress, as a 2016 World Bank report observes, over 130 million people in the region now live in informal urban settlements 'characterized by poor construction, insecure tenure and underserviced plots.' The poor are not simply left behind in the rush to make the world-class city, rather, our earlier research shows that the forced displacements, that attend world-class citymaking initiatives, often exacerbate problems in accessing urban resources and infrastructural services, particularly for the marginalised.   We have also found that, in managing and mitigating the interruptions and upheavals caused by urban removals and dislocations, innovative forms of urban practice, political engagement and creative collaboration have emerged. These, often in partnership with CBOs and NGOs, can lead to pro-poor urban outcomes.  Drawing on the strong collaborative foundations in earlier work on urban housing and infrastructures in Mumbai, Lahore and Colombo, we will focus on the efforts of the urban poor to access vital services (water, transport, communications), while attending to the ways in which these efforts intersect with the dynamics that shape patterns of access to urban land and housing. Our project will ask: under what conditions do the formal and informal communicative channels, personal connections, and 'phatic labour' (Elyachar 2005), by which everyday access to urban grids is enacted, encourage pro-poor outcomes?   We will work closely with local academic partners in this first phase of the project, but we will also mobilize non-academic partners, including arts-based activists and community groups, planners and politicians, in a series of community engagement events in each city. The goal of each event will be to create workable ideas for improving access to services. To this we add strong South-South collaboration: we will hold regional workshops each year in Colombo, which has the advantage of being equally accessible to Pakistani and Indian colleagues, bringing together project partners and stakeholders from all three sites to share their best ideas.","5,3.b",,1,0,0,,,0,0,0,1,,,,0,0,0,0,2021-01-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The technologies currently used in facilities in China (and often elsewhere) do not enable effective monitoring and thus optimisation of temperature control or any other relevant environmental factors.  Lack of optimal housing conditions is not only a bird health and welfare issue, but also a source of very significant cost to the Chinese poultry in terms of lost productivity.  Rearing chickens in sub-optimal conditions means that weight for weight, such birds require more feed than if provided with a more optimal environment.  Even a very small reduction in feed can have a significant positive effect on productivity.  Better conditions will also reduce the risk of disease and mortality to the birds.  A significant opportunity therefore exists for UK based organisations, with expertise in this field, to collaborate with Chinese partners to develop an appropriate solution, which will in particular effect an increase in productivity within the poultry sector in China.  Furthermore, it will also be a step forward in addressing the currently poor reputation of the poultry industry in China. The solution developed will have applicability in other countries around the world and may also have a use in other livestock industries.  Therefore, it is an example of an excellent export opportunity for both the UK and China.    Currently poultry facilities worldwide are constructed with a few wired sensors giving a basic temperature profile in the poultry house. What is proposed is for an autonomous robot to move around the facility capturing data continuously as it moves around and sampling the environment at various heights within the facility, from the lowest cage to the highest cage. Due to the navigation knowledge of the robot it will be able to plot the data giving a 3 dimensional view of all the parameters that the birds are exposed to, to include temperature, humidity, air velocity, CO2 and will also have an on-board camera to allow visual assessment of the conditions and potentially the birds.   In addition the development of a sensor system which is based on a current prototype 'e-nose' will allow data regarding the presence of disease to be captured for the first time. Combining all the data gathered will allow assessments to be carried out that not only detects diseases before symptoms are seen in the birds, but by cross referencing all the environmental data will allow for predictive modelling to occur and potentially for the first time allow the Chinese poultry farmer to prevent sickness in their birds, improving bird welfare, bird performance and go some way to re-building consumer confidence in the product. One key partner in the business case for this project is Applied Poultry in the UK, which already analyse data from global poultry busin",2.a,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,2021-01-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This includes thorough limits our exposure to infectious diseases such as those that cause diarrhoea, which remains a leading cause of death in children under five. Conventional approaches to reducing environmental exposure to faecal pathogens include ensuring universal access to safe water and basic sanitation. Recent evidence has suggested that this alone may be insufficient to reduce the high levels of environmental contamination seen in poor rural communities, and that transformative cross-sectoral approaches will be required to see real impacts in child health. For example, these approaches fail to address the fact that most poor rural homes have rudimentary (earth, sand or dirt) floors that are difficult to sanitise, providing an ideal environment for the survival of faecal pathogens and other parasites. These floors can also host parasitic infections including intestinal nematodes and sand fleas, both of which are responsible for considerable morbidity and poor quality of life.   We propose to examine flooring and its impact on enteric and parasitic diseases in three culturally and environmentally diverse settings in Kenya, and aim to address two related questions:  1. What is the importance of household flooring as a driver of enteric and parasitic infection risk in rural communities, and does this vary across wider social and environmental contexts? 2. Can infection risk be mitigated by replacing existing rudimentary (earth, sand or dirt) floors with improved (sealed, washable and durable) materials, and what additional behaviour changes are required to ensure impact?  We expect that successful installation and ongoing maintenance of improved flooring will reduce the transmission of enteric and parasitic infections, by preventing direct exposure and through an intermediate effect of improved domestic hygiene. This will however be influenced by local context. A priority in each setting will therefore be to explore the interplay between domestic flooring, water and sanitation infrastructure, domestic hygiene behaviours, and the wider socio-cultural and environmental context.   Our planned approach involves comprehensive formative research, intervention development conducted in collaborative partnership with recipient communities and key stakeholders, and then implementation trials to test the effects, feasibility and acceptability of the resulting intervention. We will assess the impact of the intervention on a range of child health outcomes, including prevalence of enteric and intestinal worm infections, prevalence of tungiasis, and incidence of gastrointestinal illness. We will also monitor levels of environmental contamination, and explore the impact of the intervention on domestic routines and self-reported wellness. During implementation, we will work with recipients and stakeholders at community, regional and national level to assess the extent",3.b,,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,1,,,,0,0,0,0,2021-01-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this pressing need, the Indonesian Government has  launched One Million Houses programme in the 2020-24 National Medium Term Development Plan. Vertical housing has become the preferred option in urban areas due to the lack of space and rapid rise in urbanisation, which often leads to  informal settlements and complex socio-economic problems. Despite the new initiative, however, new developments are unlikely to keep pace with the rising demand in vertical housing if local developers do not embrace new methods ofconstruction. The situation is exacerbated by the spread of Covid-19, forcing developers to implement much stricter health and safety protocols at their sites. Not only does this have the potential to lower productivity, but also increase the risk of cost and time overruns, making the 5-year national target even more difficult to achieve.The Click2Build project aims to make a paradigm shift in vertical housing construction by leveraging the potential of modular precast construction and digital technology. By integrating these two aspects, a cheaper and faster construction with a smaller carbon footprint than the traditional construction can be realised. The digital technology is introduced to  transform the industry and facilitate technology transfer with maximum impacts. Moreover, using the damage-tolerant precast elements developed in the previous UPP-SUD project, this project will create a unique opportunity to embed seismic resilience in vertical housing and hence alleviate hidden problems of poor site construction which can put  illions from a risk of harm during large earthquakes.

This will be achieved by installing a dense array of seismic recorders in the neighbourhood of the proposed site to record ground motion caused by earthquakes, and combining the new dataset with data recorded by stations deployed throughout Kalimantan, the adjacent Celebes Sea and Sulawesi, as part of the 2018 Newton grant and several follow-on projects. This will allow us to identify previously undiscovered active faults, image in detail the shallow crustal structure beneath the proposed site, develop a more comprehensive earthquake catalogue, and help construct an updated earthquake hazard map of Kalimantan that includes higher detail in the vicinity of the new capital. A key impact-component of the proposal involves teaming up with the National Earthquake Study Centre (PuSGeN) of the Ministry for Public Works and Housing, which is responsible for the development of national earthquake hazard models for Indonesia, in order to construct a new generation of hazard map for Kalimantan that can be used to inform building codes for the new capital city. Jakarta, the current capital of Indonesia, faces many challenges, including overpopulation, rapid subsidence, inundation, and high levels of earthquake, tsunami and volcanic hazard. It is primarily for these reasons that the capital is being moved to what appears to be a safer intraplate setting. However, it is essential that a detailed understanding of earthquake hazard is developed prior to the construction of the majority of the buildings and infrastructure that are an instrinsic part of modern cities. As such, the project will contribute to the long term viability of the new capital, help minimise the impact of natural hazards on its population and governance of the country, and make disaster management a more tractable task.",1.a,,0,0,0,,,2,0,0,1,,,,0,0,0,0,2021-01-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For Moldovan wineries to be able to sell their products in Western markets, they need to meet stringent phytosanitary standards and be able to trace each bottle of wine to its source. This activity funds technical assistance to establish a fully operational and functional wine and vine register in Moldova to provide a reliable database for traceability data for grape growers and wine producers. This traceability system consists of a secure computerized database housing land ownership, farmer, grape variety, field size, and yield data.  Certifications are collected by professional staff of the National Agency for Rural Development (ACSA). The database will be available to government, farmer associations, and private sector organizations so that origin requirements can be verified to meet international export market requirements. Increased access to more lucrative international markets will result in higher prices for grapes and will result in higher incomes for all segments of the industry.  Further, by opening up new markets for Moldovan wines, the country's wine sector is more insulated from Russian economic aggression...The project involves direct coordination with a successful public private partnership including Moldova's Ministry of Agriculture, Regional Development and Environment, and the National Office of Vine and Wine. Helping wineries meet the more stringent international standards will help increase Moldova's trading relations with non-CIS countries and strengthen the private sector.",,,0,1,0,,0,0,0,,,,,,0,0,1,,2021-01-01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Those most vulnerable in the pre-pandemics period - the homeless, are in greatest risk of rapidly loosing their health and endangering their health. They have almost zero access to preventive measures and services, in large percent have compromised health due to chronic physical and mental health issues and find the state health system unreachable or hardly reachable. In the context of Covid-19. The state system has not being able to respond to their needs of enabling conditions for keeping hygiene and easily accessing health-care services. This project builds upon ADRA Serbia/Partner`s being present in the targetted community in city of Belgrade and leverages its established trusting relationship and cooperation with homeless. Its focus will thus be on the 10,000 most vulnerable out of estimated 15,000 homeless in Belgrade. The most vulnerable are two groups identified by international and national strategy papers: 1) roofless homeless (living rough, in public spaces due to lack of shelters) and 2) homeless in inadequate housing (populating deserted buildings, shacks and improvised living spaces). Both are lacking water supply, sewage systems and other infrastuctural preconditions for maintaining hygiene and safeguarding their own and public health. This Project will enable innovative accessible hygiene-maintenance services (Drumodom - mobile shower/toilets), backed by distribution of basic hygiene kits. Also, outreach healtchare services - preventive and currative with focus on Covid-19, with referral, escorting and assisting in accessing the state healtcare system. Lastly, the lasting effect of this project will be the recording and analysing the acquired know-how and distribution the findings and recommendations on outreach healtcare interventions for homeless and other marginalized groups during Covid-19 and pandemics in general, to all healthcare and other professionals in the state, region of the Western Balkan.","3.4,3.3,3.2,3.1",#COVID-19,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,,,,,0,0,0,0,2020-10-06,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,,,
